# 👋 Hey there, I'm Ujan Dey

> *"Developer by day, designer by night, and an aspiring physicist in all timelines."*

I'm currently a student preparing for JEE, but coding and building stuff is how I procrastinate productively.  
Whether it's a fan site for Seedhe Maut or simulating quantum physics (yup, I really did that), I love creating cool and meaningful things on the web.

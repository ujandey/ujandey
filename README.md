# 👋 Hey there, I'm Ujan Dey

> *"Developer by day, designer by night, and an aspiring physicist in all timelines."*

I'm currently an aspiring physicist trying to understand the universe one equation at a time — but I also build cool things on the internet for fun (and sometimes for chaos).  
Whether it's a fan site for Seedhe Maut or AI-powered roast bots, I love experimenting with code and ideas that actually *feel* alive.
